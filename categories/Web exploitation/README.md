--Using a Secure Shell (SSH) is going to be pretty important.
Can you ssh as ctf-player to titan.picoctf.net at port 65352 to get the flag?
You'll also need the password 1db87a14. If asked, accept the fingerprint with yes.

USING SECURE SHELL
-ssh needs:usernme
           server
	   port number(optional) 
	   a host
-flag -p specifies port number when ssh is not using default 22
-prompted for password after(not visible while typing)
-sometimes key based authentication is used,,a keyfile is given
-flag used for the keyfile is -i and comes before p flag for port
eg ssh -i <keyfile> -p <port> <username>@<host>
